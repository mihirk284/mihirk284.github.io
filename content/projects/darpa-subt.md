I was a member of [**Team CERBERUS**](http://www.subt-cerberus.org/), the winning team of the **DARPA Subterranean Challenge**. The challenge focused on performing search and rescue missions using autonomous robots in underground settings, in GPS-denied, degraded environment and sensing conditions.

I worked on:
- Motion planning and controls for cooperation between ground and aerial robots.
- Artifact detection pipeline using YOLO-v3.
- Hardware and software framework integration for aerial and wheeled robots.
- Drone safety piloting.
