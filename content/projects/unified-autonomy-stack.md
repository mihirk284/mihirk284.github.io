The [**Unified Autonomy Stack**](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/unified_autonomy_stack) is a field-tested autonomy architecture designed to command a diverse set of robots. It provides a blueprint for generalizable robot autonomy, enabling resilient navigation in complex and degraded environments.

#### [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/unified_autonomy_stack) • [Project Website](https://ntnu-arl.github.io/unified_autonomy_stack) • [Whitepaper](https://ntnu-arl.github.io/unified_autonomy_stack/report/UnifiedAutonomyStack-Outline/) {.centered-text}

Key features include:
- Multi-modal sensor fusion for resilient SLAM.
- Advanced motion planning and control for legged and aerial robots.
- Field-tested in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge.
