### Overview
Aerial field robotics research represents the domain of study that aims to equip unmanned aerial vehicles – and as it pertains to this chapter, specifically micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) – with the ability to operate in real-life environments that present challenges to safe navigation. We present the key elements of autonomy for MAVs that are resilient to collisions and sensing degradation, while operating under constrained computational resources. We overview aspects of the state of the art, outline bottlenecks to resilient navigation autonomy, and overview the field readiness of MAVs. We conclude with notable contributions and discuss considerations for future research that are essential for resilience in aerial robotics.
