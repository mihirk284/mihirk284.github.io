### Postdoctoral Researcher at NTNU

<div class="centered-text">

Ph.D. @ [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no) (2025)<br>
M.S. @ [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/) (2021)<br>

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.no).
I completed my Ph.D. in Engineering Cybernetics in 2025 at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Kostas Alexis](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/konstantinos.alexis) and co-supervision of [Prof. Dr. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html).

I am interested in enabling operational resilience in autonomous systems through mechanisms of interleaved safety. I have extensively worked on control, navigation and planning for multirotor platforms through reinforcement learningand developed the [Aerial Gym Simulator](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/aerial_gym_simulator) to enable efficient policy learning and sim2real transfer.

I also participated in the [DARPA Subterranean Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/research/challenges/subterranean) as a key member of [Team CERBERUS](https://www.subt-cerberus.org/). Our team won the competition and received USD 2M in prize money.

<!-- 
My Ph.D. thesis, titled ["Vision-based Navigation for Aerial Robots: From Parallelized Simulation to Resilient Flight in Cluttered Environments"](https://nva.sikt.no/registration/019976cfee7c-1571705e-69c5-4f39-a32a-45f7c7913505), focuses on enabling resilient control, navigation, and planning through learned representations. I have developed the [Aerial Gym Simulator](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/aerial_gym_simulator), a massively parallelized simulation and rendering framework to enable efficient policy learning and achieve robust sim-to-real transfer for diverse multirotor platforms.

During the final year of my Bachelor's and throughout my Master's, I was part of [Team CERBERUS](https://www.subt-cerberus.org/), the winning team of the [DARPA Subterranean Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/research/challenges/subterranean). During this time, I worked on control and planning for multi-linked systems ([Bachelor's thesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896320330548)), cooperation of heterogeneous robot teams ([Master's thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/056c92619080f5962b2fd2eb43e25a57)), artifact detection, and hardware and software integration across diverse aerial and ground robot platforms. -->
