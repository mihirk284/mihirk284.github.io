### Postdoctoral Researcher at NTNU

<div class="centered-text">

Ph.D. in Engineering Cybernetics, [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no), Trondheim, Norway (2025)<br>
M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/), USA (2021)<br>

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.no). I completed my Ph.D. in Engineering Cybernetics in 2025 at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Kostas Alexis](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/konstantinos.alexis) and co-supervision of [Prof. Dr. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html).


I am interested in enabling operational resilience in autonomous systems through mechanisms of interleaved safety. I have extensively worked on control, navigation and planning for multirotor platforms through reinforcement learningand developed the [Aerial Gym Simulator](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/aerial_gym_simulator) to enable efficient policy learning and sim2real transfer.

I was a key member of the winning team ([Team CEREBRUS](https://www.subt-cerberus.org/)) at the [DARPA Subterranean Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/research/challenges/subterranean) 2021. Our team won the competition and USD 2mn in prize money.
